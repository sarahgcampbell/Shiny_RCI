#### Background Information on RCI

The **Reliable Change Index** is one way of categorizing meaningful change in individuals (as opposed to groups) in a pre- and post-test score framework. 

Specifically, RCI captures the **statistical reliability of individual changes**, that is whether the changes reflect true score differences or simply reflect random error. If the individual score change is greater than the calculated RCI value, then they’re categorized as “reliability changed (improved or declined)”; and if the individual score change is less than the RCI, then “no reliable change” has occurred.

RCI is based on the premise that psychological measurements are error-prone (i.e. not reliable), in which the observed score consists of true score and normally distributed errors. RCI uses the Classical Test Theory (CTT) framework to determine whether an individual’s pre- and post- test score change is more extreme than what is expected from just random error. In other words, if the score change is greater than a cut-off we set for tolerating random error, then it is highly unlikely that the scores did not change. 

Usually, a cut-off for determining whether an individual has changed or not is a critical value that corresponds to $\alpha$ =.05 or $\alpha$ =.10, depending on how stringent one wants it to be. Let’s say a cut-off of $\alpha$ =.05 is used, then if the RCI is greater than 1.96, the score change is reliable (95% of the time). That is, a change greater than 1.96 is highly unlikely due to random chance (and will be classified as "reliability changed"). If the RCI is less than 1.96, then the observed difference between the change scores may simply be due to random chance.
