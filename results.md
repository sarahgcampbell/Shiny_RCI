#### Q. Where can I find the SD & reliability information for CTT-RCI?
You can find the measure’s SD and reliability information on either a published test measure paper, user manuals of published scales, or your own test statistics obtained from the sample data. 

The reliability estimate can be that of test-retest reliability (used by Jacobson & Truax, 1991), alpha (used by Jabrayilov et al., 2016), McDonald’s omega (used by Lee et al., 2022), or other reliability estimates you see fit. 

You’d notice that you can only supply one SD, which is usually taken as the pre-test SD, as that is the most accessible statistic. By only using the SD of the pre-test score, one essentially assumes the variability of the post-test score is the same as the pre-test score.

#### Q. Should I use the sum score or the vector score when estimating RCI with IRT?
IRT’s biggest advantage is being able to account for the items’ (i.e., the questions on the test) characteristics. Some items may provide a lot of information about the measured trait, and others may not. Hence, supplying the vector scores can utilize the most out of IRT. 

Aggregating the vector scores into sum scores essentially treats all items as equal (i.e., equally able to discern people with high and low traits, equally informative, etc.) and defeats the one big advantage of IRT. However, sometimes sum scores are the only accessible scores. In those cases, using sum scores in IRT can still be more informative than CTT, since individuals’ variability across the test range is still being accounted for.

#### JT-RCI Plot Explained 

Individual’s pre- and post-test scores that land on the diagonal line and within the confidence band indicate no significant change, as the observed score change is likely due to the measurement variability. 

If the individual's dot land **below the diagonal line**, it means the individual's post-test score is significantly lower than their pre-test score, which shows **significant improvement** when lower scores indicate a lower trait. Scores landing **above the diagonal line** indicates **significant deterioration**.
